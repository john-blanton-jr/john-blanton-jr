##John Blanton Jr. 
# Hello, World! 👋

I am a Software Engineer specializing in Front-End Development.
I mainly work in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js. 



## 🌟 About Me 
In my free time, I often start new projects and learn new technologies. The rapid evolution of technology captivates me, and I'm thrilled to be a part of this dynamic landscape


When I am not nerding out on the computer you can find me tending to my garden, exploring trails, fishing, or cherishing moments with my family and our three pups.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters  

Beautiful is better than ugly.  
Explicit is better than implicit.  
Simple is better than complex.  
Complex is better than complicated.  
Flat is better than nested.  
Sparse is better than dense.  
Readability counts.  
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
Although practicality beats purity.  
Errors should never pass silently.  
Unless explicitly silenced.  
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
Now is better than never.  
Although never is often better than *right* now.  
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
